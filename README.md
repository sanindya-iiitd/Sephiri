# Sephiri
Sephiri means "secret" in the Sesostho language. 
(Sesotho is the national language of Lesotho, a country in Africa which is surrounded by South Africa on all sides).

# What does it do?
It helps you encrypt photographs stored on your android device before uploading them on Google Drive.
To view the encrypted photographs again, you download them from the Drive using this App and then decrypt it and store it on your device.
In order to perform encryption/decryption, it needs a key which you supply by drawing a Pattern which is similar to the Screen Lock.

More later...

# Note:
Sephiri uses the PatternLock Library: https://github.com/DreaminginCodeZH/PatternLock
